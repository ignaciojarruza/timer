# Python CLI Timer

This is a simple Python command-line interface (CLI) application that functions as a timer. It displays the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second until the user stops it by pressing Enter.

I am using this simple counter to track my time spent studying/acquiring new skills. I bullet journal by hand â€“ I might extend this CLI application to contain a database for tracking and data visualization, but for now this does the trick.

4. The timer will start running immediately, displaying the elapsed time in the format `HH:MM:SS`.
