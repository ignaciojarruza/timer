# Python CLI Timer

This is a simple Python command-line interface (CLI) application that functions as a timer. It displays the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second until the user stops it by pressing Enter.

I am using this simple counter to track my time spent studying/acquiring new skills. I bullet journal by hand â€“ I might extend this CLI application to contain a database for tracking and data visualization, but for now this does the trick.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `timer.py` file.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

```
python timer.py
```

5. The timer will start running immediately, displaying the elapsed time in the format `HH:MM:SS`.

6. Press Enter at any time to stop the timer.

7. Once stopped, the CLI will display the total elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
